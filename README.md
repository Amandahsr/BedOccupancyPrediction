# BedOccupancyPrediction
This project aims to implement, optimise and test various machine learning models to predict hospital bed occupany rates in Singapore. This project is a collaborative effort between Amanda Ho, Amos Chan, Daniel Chan, Hemanshu Ghandi, Matthew Lee and Tiana Chen. 

The dataset used to train the models tested is manually curated and contains data pulled from publicly available databases or documents. In total, 4 models are trained and tested for its effectiveness in predicting hospital bed occupancy rates. The models are Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm.
